# Dictionary-Indexer
   (By Jake "Pikachu" Zaia)

## What This Is

   This is an apparatus for quickly defining a large list of words, using the English dictionary, and creating a table of the results. It alphabetizes, states the part of speech, and defines the words in mere seconds.

   DISCLAIMER: If your teacher considers this to be cheating on your homework, the author of this script (Jake) is not to be held responsible for any damage done to your bleeding grades. Use this at your own discretion. I don't encourage cheating. (And if you do decide to use this to cheat, don't be dumb enough to get caught!)

## How To Use It

   For this you will need Python 2.7+ and thats about it:
   1) Clone the repo
   2) Run CreateDict.py using python
   3) Fill input.txt with desired words
   4) Run DefineWords.py using python
   5) Open defset.html in any browser, and you're good to go
